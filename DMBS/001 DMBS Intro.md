>The collection of data, usually refered to as the database, contains information relavent to an enterprise. 

That collection of data is organized and structured. 

Now, to handle such databases, we have some software for that. By handle, it means inserting, deleting, editing, updating, etc. 
So instead of directly interacting with the database, we will use the program, which will interact with the database in proper manner. 

> A database-management system (DBMS) is a collection of interrelated data and a set of programs to access the data. 

### Goals of dbms
1. Providing a way to store and retrieve database information that is both convenient and efficient
2. Ensuring safety of said information. 

You can store and manage data in separate files also. That is how it was used to be done. However, directly using files has several disadvantages. 
1. Data Redundancy and Inconsistency. 
2. Difficulty in accessing data. 
3. Data isolation
4. Atomicity Problems
5. Concurrent-Access Anomalies
6. Security Problems

### Instance and Schema
The overall design of a database is called "Schema" of that database.
