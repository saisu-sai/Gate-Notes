### Data models
A **data model** in a database management system (DBMS) is a **conceptual framework** used to describe how data is represented, organized, and managed in the database. It defines **how the data is stored, structured, and accessed**.

In simple terms, a data model provides a **logical structure** for the database.

For our gate syllabus, we have: 
1. Relational Data model
2. Entity-Relationship (E-R) data model. 

There's also, Object oriented model, Hierarchal model, Network model. 

#### Relational Model
The **relational model** organizes data into **tables** (also called **relations**). Each table consists of **rows** (records/tuples) and **columns** (attributes/fields).

#### E-R model
The **E-R model** represents data using collection of objects, called **entities** and **relationships** between them. It is primarily used for database design.
