The overall design of a database is called "Schema" of that database. 

There are 2 languages we use to interact with a database. 
***Data-Definition Language (DDL)*** : Any changes done to schema of the database, we use DDL.
***Data-Manipulation Language(DML)***: Any changes done to values in the database, we use DML. 

Basically, for any changes to design of the database, we use DDL and for values inside database, we use DML. 

There are 2 types of DML languages: 
1. Procedural DMLs( Imperative ): User specifies both data needed and how to get those data. 
2. Non-Procedural DMLs( Declarative ): User only specifies data needed. It will take care of how to get the data. EX: SQL
