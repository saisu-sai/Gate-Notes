###  And Gate
- takes 2 inputs, and only gives high when both inputs are high.

| A   | B   | Out |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 0   | 0   | 0   |
| 0   | 1   | 0   |
| 1   | 0   | 0   |
| 1   | 1   | 1   |

### Or gate
- Takes 2 inputs and only gives low, if both inputs are low. Otherwise, it will give high. 

### Not Gate
- Takes 1 input and gives opposite of that. 

### XOR Gate(exclusive or)
- Gives high if and only if both inputs are opposite. 
- If both are high or both are low, it gives low. 

### Nand and Nor Gates
- Just inverse of AND and OR gates. 
- However, they are special, because every other gate can be constructed by groups of only Nand or Nor gates. 

## Boolean Algebra

- And Gate on 2 inputs is treated as product of those 2 inputs in algebra with their respective binary values.  
- Or gate on inputs is treated as addition of those inputs in algebra. 
- Not gate is just complement. Drawn as a bar over top or dot or dash. ($\bar{A} , A' , \dot{A}$)
