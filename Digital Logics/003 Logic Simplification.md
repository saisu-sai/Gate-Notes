## Demorgan's theorem
Demorgan's theorem states that, if you take a boolean expression and do these following steps, then the expression basically means the same thing. 
1. invert individual terms
2. swap Or with Not and vice versa
3. Invert the entire expression
## properties
$A \cdot \bar{A} = 0$  
$A + \bar{A} = 1$
$A + AB = A$
$A + \bar{A}B = A + B$
$A + \bar{AB} = 1$
$A \oplus B = A\bar{b} + B\bar{A}$
