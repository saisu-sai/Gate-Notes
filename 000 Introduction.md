I thought I should complete the topics that are there for Sem first, so I can prepare for both Gate and Sem simultaneously. However, it doesn't matter if the course I took completes all syllabus in 1 year. 
This batch will complete entire syllabus by June next year. 

The first session is all about introduction and info regarding Gate. 

So there are different courses for CSIT and DSAI, and it appears that they have different quite different syllabus, contrary to what I believed.
DSAI has less syllabus, but has more math.  
CSIT has more programming stuff. 
I will first learn CSIT.
